# Health-monitoring-system
The Arduino Uno 4 is a cutting-edge microcontroller board that powers an integrated health monitoring system, connecting seamlessly with an Electrocardiogram (ECG) sensor, a heart rate sensor, a temperature sensor, and an SpO2 sensor. This sophisticated system not only provides real-time data visualization through the Blink app but also includes alert notifications to ensure timely responses to critical health changes.

System Components
Arduino Uno 4:
Serving as the central microcontroller, the Arduino Uno 4 efficiently manages data from multiple sensors. Its advanced processing power and connectivity options ensure smooth integration and real-time processing of health data.

ECG Sensor:
This sensor measures the electrical activity of the heart, detecting and recording ECG waveforms. It helps in diagnosing heart rhythm disorders, detecting arrhythmias, and assessing overall cardiac health.

Heart Rate Sensor:
This sensor monitors the heart rate, providing critical data on the number of heartbeats per minute.

Temperature Sensor:
The temperature sensor tracks body temperature to identify deviations from normal ranges, such as fever or hypothermia. Accurate temperature readings are crucial for diagnosing infections and monitoring febrile conditions.

SpO2 Sensor:
Measuring blood oxygen saturation levels and pulse rate non-invasively, the SpO2 sensor provides insights into respiratory function and overall oxygenation status.

Alert Notifications: The system is equipped with real-time alert notifications that are sent to the Blink app when critical health parameters deviate from preset thresholds.

Remote Patient Management: The integration with the Blink app allows for remote monitoring, enabling doctors to track patient health data outside of clinical settings. This is especially useful for managing chronic conditions and providing follow-up care.

The Arduino Uno 4-based health monitoring system, equipped with ECG, heart rate, temperature, and SpO2 sensors, provides a robust platform for patient health management. By leveraging real-time data visualization and alert notifications through the Blink app, this system empowers doctors with the tools needed for effective monitoring, timely intervention, and comprehensive patient care.
